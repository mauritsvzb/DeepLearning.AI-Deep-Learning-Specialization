# üìÑ About
The [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) offered by [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) is a series of 5 online courses designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to the field of deep learning. Created by [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/), a prominent figure in the field of artificial intelligence, this specialization covers a range of topics related to deep learning and neural networks.

This repository contains documentation and resources used to complete the certification, relevant notes and other code snippets, and proof of certification for each course.
