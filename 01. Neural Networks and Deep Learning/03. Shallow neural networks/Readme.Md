# Shallow Neural Networks
Learn to build a neural network with one hidden layer, using forward propagation and backpropagation.

The top graphical representation is the logistic regression treated as a simple neural network, whereas the bottom representation represents a neural network with 1 hidden layer. Essentially, this is two logistic regressions in sequence. Note the "<sup>[1]</sup>" and "<sup>[2]</sup>" which represent parameters belonging to the first and second layer of the neural network, respectively.
