# Neural Networks Basics
Learn to set up a machine learning problem with a neural network mindset. Learn to use vectorization to speed up your models

## Binary classification
* Mainly he is talking about how to do a logistic regression to make a binary classifier.

* He talked about an example of knowing if the current image contains a cat or not.
* Here are some notations:
    * M is the number of training vectors
    * Nx is the size of the input vector
    * Ny is the size of the output vector
    * X(1) is the first input vector
    * Y(1) is the first output vector
    * X = [x(1) x(2).. x(M)]
    * Y = (y(1) y(2).. y(M))
* We will use python in this course.
* In NumPy we can make matrices and make operations on them in a fast and reliable time.
