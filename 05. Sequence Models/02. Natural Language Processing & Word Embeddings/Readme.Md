# Goal and Learning Objectives
Natural language processing with deep learning is a powerful combination. Using word vector representations and embedding layers, train recurrent neural networks with outstanding performance across a wide variety of applications, including sentiment analysis, named entity recognition and neural machine translation.
* Explain how word embeddings capture relationships between words
* Load pre-trained word vectors
* Measure similarity between word vectors using cosine similarity
* Use word embeddings to solve word analogy problems such as Man is to Woman as King is to ______.
* Reduce bias in word embeddings
* Create an embedding layer in Keras with pre-trained word vectors
* Describe how negative sampling learns word vectors more efficiently than other methods
* Explain the advantages and disadvantages of the GloVe algorithm
* Build a sentiment classifier using word embeddings
* Build and train a more sophisticated classifier using an LSTM
